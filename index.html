        <p id="tribute-info"> The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power season 1 came to a close on Amazon Prime Video
            on 14 October 2022, capping a massively successful run for the streaming platform. In doing so, the first
            season referred to numerous minute details from the mythology created by J.R.R. Tolkien that would have been
            missed by anyone who is not deeply invested in the books or the films based on them. <br>

            </br>

            Created by J.D. Payne and Patrick McKay, the eight-episode first season has been directed by J.A. Bayona,
            Wayne Che Yip and Charlotte Brändström. The epic drama, which has the distinction of being the most
            expensive TV show of all time, is mainly based on the appendices in Tolkien’s The Hobbit and The Lord of the
            Rings books, as well as references from The Silmarillion which is a collection of expansion stories written
            by him.


            <br></br> Due to this, most of the events, the characters and their developments in the series are either
            entirely new or based on interpretations of Tolkien’s vision of Middle-earth, as it was before the times of
            The Hobbit or LOTR.


            This, however, does not mean that there are no Easter eggs for fans of Peter Jackson’s six-film adaptations
            of the two main Tolkien books — The Lord of the Rings (2001-2003) trilogy and The Hobbit (2012-2014)
            trilogy. Besides weaving new stories from the references in the literary works, the series also presents the
            origin stories of several prominent characters, significant places and major events seen in Jackson’s films.
